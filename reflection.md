1. There are a couple of ways in which streamlit and flask differ. First, streamlit is far easier to use. As opposed to flask, where more manual coding is required to achieve the same outcome, streamlit has been designed to be excellent for UI development for end users with limited coding experience. The largest difference, alluded to here, is that flask is more minimalistic where as streamlit is more robust. In terms of deployment, flask can be deployed to a number of web platforms and servers, whereas streamlit has built-in support for deploying applications to their free platform.

2. There are a few reasons one might choose flask over streamlit. First, flask allows for much more customization, which is useful if you have an incredibly specific end product in mind. If you are working on a team that is more familiar with flask, as it is more common, choosing flask may save time and allow team members to better work together. Lastly, flask is better suited to a wider variety of applications. Streamlit is specifically good for data-driven applications, while flask can be used for applications that do not rely on data or are large and complex.
